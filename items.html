      <h2>1. Gas Mask</h2>
      <p>
       The Gas Mask is a protective gear that helps players breathe safely in areas filled with 
       decontamination gas, such as lockrooms or gas catwalks. Normally, the gas makes your character 
       cough and blink more often, making it harder to see and move around. Wearing the Gas Mask 
       prevents these effects, letting you explore without trouble-though your vision will be a bit 
       foggy or darker while using it.

        The keycards that exists around the site, are one of the most essential tools that serves as a

        The S-NAV is designed to help players navigate and keep track of the rooms they've explored. 
        Each square on the map represents a single room, giving a clear overview of your progress. 
        There are three distinct variations of the S-NAV, each offering a unique way to visualize it.
